## A few consideration about this doc !

This Quarto document serves as a pratical illustration of the concepts covered in the productive workflow online course. It's designed primarily for **educational purposes**, so the focus is on demonstrating Quarto techniques rather than on the rigor of its scientific content.
:::

## Introduction

This document offers a straightforward analysis of the well-know penguin dataset. It is designed to complement the [Productive R Workflow](https://www.productive-r-workflow.com/r/module2/format-text-with-markdown) online course.

You can read more about the penguin dataset [here](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).

Let's load libraries before we start!

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
# load the tidyverse
library(tidyverse)
library(hrbrthemes)    # ipsum theme for ggplot2 charts
library(patchwork)     # combine charts together
library(DT)            # To attache datatable - interactive tables
library(knitr)         # to use fonction kable() static table
library(plotly)        # interactive graphs
```

## Loading data

The dataset has already been loaded and cleaned in the previous step of this pipemine.

Let's load the clean version, together with a few functions available in `functions.R` (we create a **function** to show *ggplot* graphique).

```{r}
# Source functions
source(file="functions.R")
# Read the clean dataset
data <- readRDS(file = "../input/clean_data.rds")
```

In case you're wondering how the original dataset looks like, here is a searchable version of it, made using the `DT`package :

```{r}
datatable(data, options = list(pageLength = 5), filter = "top")
```

## Bill length and Bill Depth

Now, let's make some descriptive analysis, including <b>summary statistics</b> and <b>graphs</b>.

What's striking is the <b>slightly negative relationship</b> between `bill length` and `bill depth`:

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.align='center', fig.cap = "Relationship between bill <b>length</b> and bill <b>depth</b>. <b>All</b> data points included."}
# # Summary
# summary(data)

# Calculating mean bill length for different species and islands using dplyr
data %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  group_by(island) %>%
  summarize(mean_bill_length = round(mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE), 2))

# Use the function in functions.R
# create_scatterplot(data, "Adelie", "Torgersen")
# create interactive graph

p <- data %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)
  ) +
    geom_point(color="#69b3a2") +
    labs(
      x = "Bill Length (mm)",
      y = "Bill Depth (mm)",
      title = paste("Surprising relationship?")
    ) + 
  theme_ipsum()
ggplotly(p)

```

It is also interesting to note that `bill length` a and `bill depth`are quite different from one specie to another.

$${\displaystyle Avg={\frac {1}{n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}a_{i}={\frac {a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots +a_{n}}{n}}}$$ `bill length`and `bill depth`averages are summarized in the 2 tables below.

This is summarized in the 2 tables below :

```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 2

# data %>% 
#   group_by(species) %>% 
#   summarise(average_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = T))

# data %>% 
#   group_by(species) %>% 
#   summarise(average_bill_depth = mean(bill_depth_mm, na.rm = T))

bill_length_per_specie <- data %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise(average_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = T))

kable(bill_length_per_specie)
bill_depth_per_specie <- data %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise(average_bill_depth = mean(bill_depth_mm, na.rm = T))

kable(bill_depth_per_specie)
bill_length_adelie <- bill_length_per_specie %>% 
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>% 
  pull(average_bill_length) %>% 
  round(2)

```

For instance, the average bill length for the specie `Adelie`is 38.81.

Now let's check the relationship between bill depth and bill length for the specie `Adelie`on the island `Torgersen` :

```{r,  warning=F, fig.height=3, fig.width=9, fig.cap="There is actually a positive correlation when split by species."}
# Use the function in functions.R
p1 <- create_scatterplot(data, "Adelie", "#6689c6")
p2 <- create_scatterplot(data, "Chinstrap", "#e85252")
p3 <- create_scatterplot(data, "Gentoo", "#9a6fb0")

p1 + p2 + p3
```
